# _FinalProject
Hello this is my Final Project and please kindly check all the files thank you.

This code is for design only and not to make it official.
my code is in the files
You can see that i didn't add Javascript because this is for design only.
You can see in the homepage the navigation home,about us, strands, gallery, news/events, and contact us.
I also included some history of our school and add some many images that i took when i was studying there.
I included at least 10-15 pages in this website so be sure to check it and click on the nav bar.
I started drawing wireframes and yes, i did it at first time but i kinda rechange my design because it is too hard for me.
At starting point i am trying everything that fits on my website so that it will be good and not bad in the eyes.
I want to make everything up as i go along and I understand all the details. I also make sure that my plan is completed before submitting it. 
I did some effort doing this and also I ask my brother on how to make it detail oriented
My website is simple yet unique in it's own ways. I know that I did a lot of mistakes doing this website but rest assured that mistakes won't be in the future.

You can see all the courses/strand, and pictures in the gallery and also thank you very much!
